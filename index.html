          <p>
            I was born on the 21 of July In 1964. As a child, I was orphaned and left with no memory of my parents or if they were alive. I was accepted by a man named Goken, who raised me and took on my training as a martial artist.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew up to be a quiet and serious man, yes. My main goal is to master my fighting style perfectly. I love to travel and I take my travel and training very seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to teach people the skills I have achieved, but it requires special things, so if you want to be like me you need to acquire one of these things and then you can become like me.
